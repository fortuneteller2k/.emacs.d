#+TITLE: Emacs configuration

opinionated set of emacs lisp files


* ?

 * [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management
 * [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][selectrum]] for completion UI (ones you see for =M-x=, =C-h f=, =C-h v=, etc...)
 * [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] instead of [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] for the LSP client
 * embrace variable pitch for titles and headings
 * no font icons where deemed unnecessary
 * defer *everything* if possible (an exception was made for =no-littering=)

** Notes

 * Use the =(pkg! NAME &rest ARGS)= macro instead of =(use-package NAME &rest ARGS)= function.
   - Not only is it shorter, but it also allows tracking of the amount of packages installed. (see =packaging--loaded-packages=)
