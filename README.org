#+TITLE: Emacs configuration

opinionated set of emacs lisp files


* ?

 * [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management
 * [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] for completion UI (ones you see for =M-x=, =C-h f=, =C-h v=, etc...)
 * [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] instead of [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] for the LSP client
 * embrace variable pitch for titles and headings
 * no font icons where deemed unnecessary
 * defer *everything* if possible (an exception was made for =no-littering= and =exec-path-from-shell=)

** Notes

 * Use the =(pkg! NAME &rest ARGS)= macro instead of =(use-package NAME &rest ARGS)= function.
   - Not only is it shorter, but it also allows tracking of the amount of packages installed. (see =pkg!-installed=) 

*** Tips, Tricks, and Magic

I employ several magical hacks, tips and tricks, used by other Emacs users, in order for my =emacs-init-time=,  be under 1 second.

 * Avoid =set-face-attribute= when possible.
   - In the case where this isn't possible, hook these calls to =emacs-startup=.

 * Frame modifications must be done in =early-init.el=.

 * Defer loading of packages with =(setq use-package-always-defer t)=.
   - This is the most important and impactful.
   - Employ the use of =:hook=, =:bind=, =:mode=, and others to load packages when they are needed.

 * Relax the garbage collector during start up.
   - Also use =gcmh=, the Garbage Collector Magic Hack.

 * Unset =file-name-handler-alist= during start up.

 * Set the initial major mode to =fundamental-mode=.

 * Use the latest Emacs from Git, where the =native-comp= feature has been merged.
